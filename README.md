<p> I wanted to create an app that would generate a theme for a clothing collection and display a mood board to go along with the output. My goal was to create a generator that would inspire an idea for a new fashion collection. I designed the site based off of a magazine cover and wanted it to have the feel of a virtual catalog. </p>
